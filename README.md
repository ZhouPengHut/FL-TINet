## Attention



It is recommended to use 608x608 images for training when dealing with various weights in the code.

Both 608×608 and 416×416 can be used. If the graphics card capacity is large in the
experiment, the input image size can be selected as 608×608. If the graphics card capacity is
relatively small, it is advisable to choose 416×416 as the input image size.
